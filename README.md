### âœ… **How to Navigate**
- Each folder (`WeekX_ProjectName`) contains:
    - `README.md` with project summary, objectives, tools, and screenshots
    - Supporting files (e.g., diagrams, config files, slides)

---

## ðŸ“š What I Learned Each Week (Capstone Security+ Cohort)

### âœ… Week 1 â€“ Cybersecurity Foundations & Risk Management
- Gained an understanding of cybersecurity principles aligned with the **CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)**.
- Learned about risk assessment methodologies, compliance standards (**NIST**, **ISO 27001**), and their importance in **GRC roles**.
- Explored security frameworks and controls that form the foundation for enterprise security programs.

---

### âœ… Week 2 â€“ Networking & Security Fundamentals
- Built knowledge of **TCP/IP**, subnetting, VLANs, and NAT.
- Understood how **firewalls, routers, and switches** enforce network segmentation and protect against threats.
- Learned basic troubleshooting and configuration for secure network environments.

---

### âœ… Week 3 â€“ Security Tools & Threat Analysis
- Gained hands-on experience using **SIEM concepts** and understanding event logging for detection of anomalies.
- Learned how to analyze threat intelligence reports and identify common attack vectors (phishing, malware, insider threats).
- Practiced applying risk management concepts to mitigate vulnerabilities.

---

### âœ… Week 4 â€“ Linux Virtualization & Command Line Lab
- Installed and configured **Ubuntu Linux in VirtualBox** to simulate enterprise environments.
- Practiced **file permissions (`chmod`, `chown`)** and user management for OS-level security.
- Learned how **Linux logs and configurations** support compliance and system hardening.

---

### âœ… Week 5 â€“ Incident Response & Forensics Basics
- Gained exposure to **Incident Response (IR) frameworks** like NIST 800-61.
- Learned the phases of IR: **Preparation, Detection, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned**.
- Practiced basic forensic evidence handling and the importance of **chain of custody**.

---

### âœ… Week 6 â€“ Small Office Network Build
- Designed and simulated a **LAN environment** using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Configured IP addressing, NAT, and basic router/switch security.
- Understood how network topology impacts performance, scalability, and security compliance.

---

### âœ… Week 7 â€“ Security Policies & Compliance
- Developed and reviewed **security policies** related to access control, incident response, and password management.
- Learned the role of **IT General Controls (ITGC)** in governance and regulatory compliance (SOX, HIPAA).
- Understood how policies align with organizational risk management strategies.

---

### âœ… Week 8 â€“ Capstone Project & Presentation
- Consolidated hands-on labs into a **comprehensive security program overview**.
- Practiced presenting technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders for business impact.
- Demonstrated proficiency across **GRC, SOC fundamentals, and Security+ domains** in a real-world scenario.
